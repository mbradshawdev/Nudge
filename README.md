Nudge!
------

Brief:  
Nudge the active window with hotkeys [Ctrl]+[Alt](+[Shift]) & [Arrow Keys]

Usage:  
Launch script (personally: with Launchy)  
Hold [Ctrl]+[Alt] and press [Arrow Keys] to nudge the active window 10px in any direction
Hold [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Shift] and press [Arrow Keys] to nudge only 1px
[ESC] to quit Nudge

Description:  
Another AutoHotKey script to better utilise a partially obscured TV screen tucked away in a weird spot!  
Allows the user to nudge any window a few pixels including off-screen which Windows doesn't directly allow.  
Notably, and the reason for creating this, the user can nudge a window upwards a little off-screen to hide it's title bar.
Posting here to demonstrate my improving coding ability (pls give me a job) and to keep active on here.  
And if anyone actually reads this: Any feedback/improvements/suggestions/employment welcome! Thanks!
